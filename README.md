##ScrollMap
####Copyright (c) 2015 Minikutty

A scrollmap is an android application which acts as a multifunction navigation instrument, showing the current location on a chart and the feet above sea level. This app mainly provides the scrolling map functionality of a GPS.

There are 3 modes of operation in this application.
* top of the image always pointing north
* top of the image always pointing to the direction of motion
* the image showing the driver’s perspective or driver’s view

For future enhancements:
Implement the algorithm for calculating directions, reading GPS coordinates and downloading licensed maps like Google maps.
