## Manual

This app doesn't reqiure any detailed description on how to use. It's very straight forward.

This app assumes that the longitudes and latitudes can be obtained from the GPS feature aleady present in the Android device. 
So the start location, end location and the path from source to destination is hardcoded in this source code. 
And hence, when you start the app, you can see the marker (green circle) is moving from the source to the destination. 
Actually the marker is stable at a point and the map is scrolling from source to destination. The speed of movement 
is also hardcoded in the source file.

Once the app starts and the marker appears to start moving, you can tap on the touchscreen or mouse click on emulator, 
to select the three different modes of operation. By default, the app shows mode 1, which provides a 2D View and the 
top of the image always pointing north. Once we tap the touchscreen or mouse click on emulator, the app shows mode 2, 
which is also a 2D view but top of the image is always pointing to the direction of motion. Another tap on the 
touch screen or mouse click on emulator, the app shows mode 3, which is a 3D View and the image shows the 
driver’s perspective or driver’s view.

This app provides the map scrolling functionality of a GPS. It has to be integrated with GPS to make a full fledged GPS app.
